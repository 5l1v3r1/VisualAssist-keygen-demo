# VisualAssist-keygen

[ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆREADME](README.zh-CN.md)

Actually, this repo isn't integral. There is a project called `VisualAssist-patcher` in my computer which can replace official public key stored in `VA_X.dll` with our own public key, so that the registration key generated by `VisualAssist-keygen` can really work. 

However, I don't want to receive a DMCA takedown notice. Also I don't want to let `Whole Tomato`, the developer of Visual Assist, figure out an anti-patch solution for Visual Assist.

__So, everything about `VisualAssist-pathcer` is masked out by character `*`.__

## 0. DMCA

This repo __DOES NOT__ contain any substantial infringing content. It only contains my own implement for the registration algorithm used by Visual Assist. And the registration key generated by `VisualAssist-keygen` __CANNOT__ activate Visual Assist __IN FACT__.

## 1. How does it work?

Well, I am too lazy to write it. ðŸ¤ª

If this repo gets 100 stars, I'll tell you how it works.

## 2. How to build?

see [here](doc/how-to-build.md).

## 3. How to use?

2. Generate a registation key for Visual Assist.

   ```
   Usage:
       VisualAssist-keygen.exe <username> <license count> <expire date>

           <username>         The username licensed to.
                              This parameter must be specified.

           <license count>    The maximum number of copies that can be run under the newly-generated license.
                              The value should be in 1 ~ 65536.
                              This parameter must be specified.

           <expire date>      The date when the newly-generated license expires.
                              The format must be one of the following:
                                  1. "yyyy/mm/dd"
                                  2. "yyyy-mm-dd"
                                  3. "yyyy.mm.dd"
                              This parameter must be specified.
